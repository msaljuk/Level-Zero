# Level Zero - a 3rd person multiplayer ActionRoguelike
CS193U - Videogame Development in Unreal - Project

## Final Project

For my final CS193U project, I've made the following additions/improvements:

#### 1. Buy Station to Buy Actions/Abilities/Respawn
I've created a buy station that allows players to buy given actions/abilities as well as respawn dead players in multiplayer. This Buy Station is an interactable actor in the world. Upon interaction, it creates a local widget that allows the player to browse purchasable abilities, read their details and select the one(s) they want to buy using their credits. See the following screenshots for more details:

#### 2. Double-Damage Buff
ActionEffect that changes the outgoing damage for its owner for 60 seconds. This damage multiplier is applied when the magic projectile deals damage.

#### 3. Players drop all of their credits on death into an Actor.
This Actor (SCoin - derived from SPowerUp) can be picked up by any other player by interacting with it, at which point they receive the dead player's credits. 

#### 4. Minor Improvements/Fixes 
I've also made several minor improvements and fixes in my project. Examples include incorporating past assignment feedback to make multiplayer rage replication more robust and redesigning the crosshair widget to appear more like a crosshair instead of a simple square box.
